- # Supervised ML
  Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, 
  machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.
  
  E.g : Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc

- ## Regression : (Output type : numerical)
- Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable. It is used for the prediction of continuous variables.
  - Linear Regression
  - Regression Trees
  - Non-Linear Regression
  - Bayesian Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression

- ## Classification :
- Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.
