## Some Machine learning techniques:
---
- Regression/Estimation:
  - Predicting continuous values
- Classification:
  - Predicting the item class/category of a case 
- Clustering:
  - Finding the structure of data; summarization
- Associations:
  - Associating frequent co-occurring items/events
- Anomly detection
  - Discovering abnormal and unusual cases
- Sequence mining
  - Predicting next events; click stream(Markov Model, HMM)
- Dimension Reduction
  - Reducing the size of data(PCA)
- Recommendation Systems
  - Recommending items
 
## Python libraries:
- NumPy :
Math library to work with N-dimensional arrays. For working with arrays, dictionaries, functions, datatypes and working with images you need to know NumPy.
---
- Scipy :
SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.
It is a good library for scientific and high performance computation.
---
- Matplotlib :
Matplotlib is a plotting package that provides 2D plotting, as well as 3D plotting.
---
- Pandas :
It is a high-level Python library that provides high performance easy to use data structures. It has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis.
---
- Scikit Learn:
SciKit Learn is a free Machine Learning Library for the Python programming language. It has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms,
and it's designed to work with a Python numerical and scientific libraries: NumPy and SciPy. It has pre-processing of data, feature selection, feature extraction,
train test splitting, defining the algorithms, fitting models, tuning parameters, prediction, evaluation, and exporting the model.
